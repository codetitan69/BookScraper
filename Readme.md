# 📚 **BookScraper** - A Professional Web Scraper for Book Data

**BookScraper** is a web scraping project built using **Scrapy** that extracts detailed information from [Books to Scrape](https://books.toscrape.com). This scraper collects key book data such as title, category, description, price, and availability, which can be outputted in a JSON format or saved to a PostgreSQL database.

## 🚀 **Key Features**

- **Comprehensive Scraping:** Scrapes all available books from [Books to Scrape](https://books.toscrape.com), a website listing a large collection of books.
- **Data Extraction:** Collects the following book details:
  - **Title**
  - **Category**
  - **Description**
  - **Price**
  - **Availability Count**
- **Output Formats:** Data can be saved in a `booksData.json` file (default). Optionally, data can also be stored in a **PostgreSQL** database.
- **Dynamic User-Agent Rotation:** The scraper uses dynamic user-agent rotation for each request to avoid being blocked or flagged by the website.

## ⚙️ **Installation Guide**

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BookScraper.git
cd BookScraper
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
Install the required libraries by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: requirements.txt should contain the following dependencies:

scrapy
psycopg2-binary
fake-useragent
🕷 Running the Spider
Run the Spider for JSON Output (Default)
To run the spider and store the scraped data in booksData.json, use:

scrapy crawl bookSpyder
This will initiate the spider, which will scrape the website and store the results in booksData.json located in your project directory.

Run the Spider with PostgreSQL Integration (Optional)
Enable the PostgreSQL Pipeline:

To store the scraped data in a PostgreSQL database, open the settings.py file and uncomment the line for the DBpipeline:


ITEM_PIPELINES = {
    "BookScraper.pipelines.DemobookscraperPipeline": 300,
    "BookScraper.pipelines.DBpipeline": 400,  # Uncomment to use DB pipeline
}
Database Setup:

Ensure you have a PostgreSQL database named Scrapy running, and update the credentials in pipelines.py under DBpipeline accordingly.

🧠 How It Works
Start Crawling: The spider begins crawling from the homepage of Books to Scrape.

Follow Links: It follows each book’s individual page for detailed data.

Data Extraction: Each book’s page is parsed using CSS Selectors and XPath to extract relevant details.

Handle Pagination: The spider automatically detects and follows pagination links to scrape multiple pages.

Store Data: The scraped data can be saved either in a JSON file or directly into a PostgreSQL database, depending on the configuration.

Middleware: Dynamic User-Agent rotation ensures that each request uses a different User-Agent header, helping to avoid detection and blocking.

🛠 Optional Configuration: PostgreSQL Integration
If you want to store the scraped data in a PostgreSQL database:

Install psycopg2 for PostgreSQL interaction:

pip install psycopg2-binary
The database schema is automatically created during the first scrape. You can modify the database connection details in the DBpipeline class found in pipelines.py.
